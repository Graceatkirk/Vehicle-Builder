# Vehicle-Builder

## Description

The Vehicle-Builder is a command-line application that allows users to create and manage vehicle information interactively. Built with JavaScript and TypeScript, this application utilizes Node.js for backend processing and Inquirer for a user-friendly command-line interface. Users can create various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes, and input detailed information about each vehicle.

- Support for multiple vehicle types: Car, Truck, and Motorbike
- Ability to input detailed vehicle information, including make, model, year, VIN, color, weight, max speed, and wheel specifications
- Object-oriented design with separate classes for vehicles and wheels
- Easy to use and navigate through the terminal

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Main programming language used for application logic
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and enhances code quality
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code
- **Inquirer**: Library for creating interactive command-line interfaces
- **ES6 Classes**: Used to define vehicle and wheel structures
